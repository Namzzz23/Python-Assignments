# 2 Design a Python application that creates two threads named EvenFactor and OddFactor.

# Both threads should Accept one integer number as a parameter The EvenFactor thread should
# Identify all even factors of the given number Calculate and display the sum of even factors
# The OddFactor thread should : Identify all odd factors of the given number.
# Calculate and display the sum of odd factors.
# after both threads complete execution, the main thread should display the message
# "Exit from main"
