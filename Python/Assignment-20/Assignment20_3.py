# 3. Design a Python application that created two threads named EvenList and OddList.

# -> Both threads should accept a list of integers as input.
# -> The EvenList thread should:
#       -> Extraxt all even elements from the list.
#       -> Calculate and display their sum.
# -> The OddList thread should:
#       -> Extraxt all odd elements from the list.
#       -> Calculate and display their sum.
# -> Threads should run concurrently.
