# 5. Design a Python application that creates two threads named Thread1 and Thread2.

#   ->  Thread1 should display numbers from 1 to 50.
#   ->  Thread2 should display numbers from 50 to 1 in reverse order.
#   ->  Ensure that : 
#       ->  Thread2 starts execution only after Thread1 has completed.
#   ->  use appropriate thread synchronization

import threading

    for i in range(1, 51):
        print(i)

def ReverseDisplay1To50():
    for i in range(50, 0, -1):
        print(i)


def main():
    t1 = threading.Thread(target= Display1To50)
    t2 = threading.Thread(target= ReverseDisplay1To50)
