# 1 Design a Python application that creates two separate threads named Even and Odd.

# -> The Even thread should display the first 10 even numbers.
# -> The Odd thread should display the first 10 odd numbers
# -> Both threads should execute independently using the threading module.
# -> Ensure proper thread creation and execution
