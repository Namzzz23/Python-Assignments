# 3 Write a Python program to implement a class named Arithmetic with the following characteristics:

#   -> The class should contain two instance variables: Valuel and Value2.
#   -> Define a constructor (init) that initializes all instance variables to 0.
#   -> Implement the following instance methods:
#       -> Accept() - accepts values for Valuel and Value2 from the user.
#       -> Addition() - returns the addition of Valuel and Value2.
#       -> Subtraction() - returns the subtraction of Valuel and Value2.
#       -> Multiplication() - returns the multiplication of Valuel and Value2.
#       -> Division() - returns the division of Valuel and Value2 (handle division by zero properly).
#   ->Create multiple objects of the Arithmetic class and invoke all the instance methods
