# 3.Write a program which contains filter(), map() and reduce() in it. Python application which
# contains one list of numbers, List contains the numbers which are accepted from user. Filter
# should filter out all such numbers which greater than or equal to 70 and less than or equal to
# 90. Map function will increase each number by 10. Reduce will return product of all that
# numbers.
# Input List = [4, 34, 36, 76, 68, 24, 89, 23, 86, 90, 45, 70]
# List after filter = [76, 89, 86, 90, 70]
# List after map = [86, 99, 96, 100, 80]
# Output of reduce = 6538752000
